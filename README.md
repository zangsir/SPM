# to do pitch estimation and plot pitch contours from sound files in a directory
currently I use praat autocorrelation to do pitch estimation. run the shell scripts to run praat pitch estimation, and python plots (generating pdf files of pitch contour plot matrixes of the input sound files). Currently it is hardwired to read *.flac files from the CMN corpus, but can be changed.
